Text in bold from lesson plan 

**Note: You can postpone this lesson until you have a Mac computer**

I don’t have a Mac but I want to read through this anyway and get familiar with it

## Goals:
* Become familiar with navigating the MacOSX environment
* Understand why and how to utilize multiple tabs, application windows, and desktops
* Start using application shortcuts and hotkeys
* Effectively find applications, folders, and files
* Effectively manage open applications

| What the command does | Mac shortcut |
| :--- | :--- |
| Copy | Command (⌘) + C |
| Paste | Command (⌘) + V|
| Cut | Command (⌘) + X|
| Save | Command (⌘) + S|
| Select | Command (⌘) + A is to select all |
| Undo | Command (⌘) + Z |
| Redo | Command (⌘) +Shift+ Z |
| Find | Command (⌘) + F|
| Switch app | Command (⌘) + Tab|
| Open spotlight search | Command (⌘) + Space bar|
| Force quit | For open app: press Command-Shift-Option-Esc and hold for 3 seconds|
| Full-screen screen shot | Option + Command (⌘) + Esc|
| User-defined region screen shot | Shift + Command (⌘) + 4|

Dock, Finder, Menu bar (context sensitive), Mission control, Mouse & Trackpad.  

Double clicking a menu bar will force the window to take up your entire screen size

Didn’t know about window snapping Cinch, Divvy, Slate, and Spectacle
Cool!


## Practice tasks:
1. Use Spotlight to open the finder
    * What does tab do in finder?
    * What does shift + tab do in finder?
2. Do the following commands using only the keyboard:
    1. Open your web browser
    2. Navigate to adadevelopersacademy.org
    3. Keeping the Ada browser tab open, open a new tab
    4. Navigate to google.com
    5. Navigate back to the Ada tab
    6. Refresh the web page
    7. Quit out of the web browser (don't just close the tabs, close the whole application)
3. Use Spotlight to open Finder, web browser, system preferences and then switch between all three applications
