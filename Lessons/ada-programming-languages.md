### Goal:
* Develop an understanding of how languages are used in combination to create a web application

### Overview: 
**Programming languages exist so that humans can give instructions to computers. Fundamentally, programming is about communication. Programming languages are similar to human spoken languages, they have dialects, grammars, colloquialisms, idioms, and parts of speech.**
What is the difference between a colloquialism and an idiom?

Both are found in every language. Idiom has French roots. Idiom is a phrase- if it does not make literal sense in the context of the sentence, it is an idiom. Colloquialisms are informal words or phrases- there's a more formal alternative. Most idioms are colloquial- informal.

### Classification: 

#### Level:
A way to classify programming languages. Level means how close a language is to binary code- 0s and 1s. C is low-level. Ruby, Java, and Python are high-level. High level is more like speech and there’s more going on behind the scenes

#### Compiled or Interpreted:
A way to classify programming languages. Languages by type means compiled or interpreted. Compiled languages go back to binary before they work
Interpreted languages have a program that does this (going back to binary). There’s a program that runs the program. More: "compiled and interpreted languages can be divided into dynamically typed and statically typed languages. Statically typed programming languages do type checking (the process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types) at compile-time as opposed to run-time. Dynamically typed programming languages do type checking at run-time as opposed to compile-time."

### Languages: 
#### Ruby:
Ruby is 1993- Japanese, written for people. It's high level like Python, and dynamically typed, so it does fact-checking at run-time, not compile-time. 
Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto.

#### HTLM & CSS: 

HTML is the skeleton- markup
CSS is the clothes- style sheet

#### Javascript:

Javascript is interpreted and dynamically typed. It's often used with HTML and CSS.
#### Frameworks:

Frameworks are part of the work done for you, then you can build off that, use those tools. Includes programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and APIs.
#### Ruby on Rails:

Ruby on Rails is a framework- Model-View-Controller. Provides defaults you can customize and build off of to make a web application. Includes database, web service and web pages.
