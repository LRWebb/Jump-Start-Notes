## Lesson 3: Effective Internet Searching

[Link to Ada Academy lesson 3](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/tree/master/preparing-to-code/internet-searching)

Text in bold from lesson plan 

### Goals:
**To know where to go for answers **
To be able to evaluate a source as likely to have the answer you are looking for (or not)
To be able to narrow your search results to yield better results
To find answers to a question on your own
What's most important is that you can find the answer, not that you know the answer right away.**

StackOverflow
Google

“My mom still waits for me to come home during breaks to transfer new music to her MP3 player (which I bought her).”
Yes me too!!! Also identifying with not knowing where to start to bridge the gap, feeling like I missed out by not starting programming as a teenager, but keeping going still

“the answer was out there, somewhere.”
"The gap is not insurmountable because I have what it takes to learn." <3
"all we really need is the opportunity to see that it’s not hopeless. It’s not about what we already know, it’s about how we learn. It’s about the tenacity"
Good encouraging writing to not give up- not knowing doesn't mean failure, it means you’re not where you want to be yet, and you can still get there

Google video! Matt Cutts- “You aren’t actually searching the web, you’re searching Google’s index of the web” Google’s software asks questions of the page results to determine which ones to show you and in which order

Interesting: “When people use Google search to hunt the web, they generally search for things using the same language that they would use for speaking. Unfortunately, websites don’t say things the way people do; instead, they try to use language that sounds professional”

**20 Tips to Google Search Efficiently:**
1. Use the tabs- broadest categories to narrow in Google's search engine
2. Use quotes- to find a specific phrase, not the keywords
3. Use a hyphen to exclude words- especially useful for words with multiple meanings like "drive"
4. Use a colon to search specific sites- I should do this more. I always forget about this. Syntax: in search bar type: pear site: https://minimalistbaker.com/  
5. Find a page that links to another page- like finding the other city that a road links to- Syntax: in search bar type: link:www.amphilsoc.org 
6. Use the asterisk wildcard- especially useful to use in the middle of a phrase where you don't know one of the words. Syntax  *  
7. Find sites that are similar to other sites- Syntax: in search bar type: related:chess.com 
8. Use Google search to do math- type the math problem in the search bar
9. Search for multiple words at once- use OR to get either
10. Search a range of numbers- use two dots before a number or in between two numbers. Using two dots before a number will only return that, not higher or lower, and using two dots between two numbers will return answers that are in the range between the two numbers.
11. Keep it simple- using the keyword "nearby" will narrow your search to what's close
12. Gradually add search terms- start simple, then add terms to refine if you haven't found what you want. Do more than one search.
13. Use words that websites would use- Google is not a person. It's searching website text- that text is often written professionally, not like daily speech
14. Use important words only- similar to tip above, don't type out a question in full the way you would ask a friend. Use keywords to narrow. 
15. Google search has shortcuts- Google has a number of commands that will do a certain thing that originally would have taken more steps. Examples are: 
Weather *zip code* – This will show you the weather in the given zip code. You can also use town and city names instead of area codes, but it may not be as accurate if there are multiple area codes in the city. 
What is *celebrity name* Bacon Number – This is a fun little one that will tell you how many connections any given celebrity has to famed actor Kevin Bacon. The popular joke, Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, is that no actor is more than 6 connections away from Kevin Bacon. Mark Zuckerberg has a Bacon Number of 3. 
The math example posted above is another one. 
What is the definition of *word* or Define: *word* – This will display the definition of a word. 
Time *place* – This will display the time in whatever place you type in. 
You can check any stock by typing its ticker name into Google. If you search for GOOG, it will check the stock prices for Google. 
16. Spelling doesn't necessarily matter- Google is a computer, but it's a computer that knows common spelling mistakes people make
17. Use descriptive words- and try using different ways to say it- "how to" is not the same as "troubleshoot," and one may be more useful than the other to you at different times.
18. Find a specific file- syntax: *internet privacy* filetype:pdf
19. Money and unit conversions- like doing math in the search bar, can convert miles to km, dollars to pounds, etc
20. Track your packages- enter the tracking number into the search bar

Clicked on Google's Tips and Tricks and also found these tips:

| Use this:                | To do this:           | Like this for example:
|--------------------|---------------------| --------------------
| movies 	  | find movies & theaters nearby (zip or city)	  | movies 94043
| flight status  | 	 get flight status with the airline & flight number	  | HA 124
| intitle:		  | find words in the title of the webpage		  | intitle:inspirational

#### Addtl. Techniques:
* Type using keywords instead of full sentences
* Add 'example' to your query if you want to see an example
* Add the specific language you are coding in to your query, e.g. 'ruby'
* Use double quotations when you need an exact match in your search
* Make sure to check the date of what you are referencing, languages often change over time

I also like to add phrases that could bring up a tutorial that also explains the how and the why, instead of just steps- like adding “how I” to what you want to do can bring up blog posts that have tutorials
