# Lesson 7: Environment Setup

[Link to Ada Academy lesson 7](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/tree/master/preparing-to-code/environment-setup)

Text in bold from lesson plan 

## Learning Goals:
* **To setup a development environment**  
* **Gain confidence in using interactive Ruby (`irb`)**  
* **Gain confidence in using Atom**  

## Activities:
:heavy_check_mark: Review notes  
:large_orange_diamond: Need :computer: Complete install fest- half done  
:heavy_check_mark: (Optional) [Creating a gist from Atom](gist-from-atom.md)  

Did it!! Hello Gisty :) https://gist.github.com/0604741e66a346025fce5912e06f967f  

## Notes:

irb means Interactive Ruby  
REPL is an acronym for Read Evaluate Print Loop  
IDEs are more powerful than text editors  
Text editors allow you to write without visible or hidden formatting attaching to the characters.   

irb is one way to use Ruby + computer. The other way is to put the Ruby code on a file then ask the computer to read and execute the code in the file. We'll do both.   

I have a Linux laptop. I need a mac before I can do some of this :( heading over to look at Atom and see if they have a Linux version  

Installfest 
See Lesson 8 for install screenshots:  
Notes on this install are in my Lesson 8 notes:  
"Based on the email/GitHub message from Ada today, I'm going back to Lesson 7- Atom and Ruby at least- Notes in this one though as I'm doing it on the 22nd  

I do have Chrome  
I also have Sublime Text- Atom looks cool too    

**For Ada, need a Mac with Sierra or El Capitan, El Capitan is preferred**  

**Trust, but Verify**
