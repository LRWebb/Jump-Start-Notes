[Link to Ada Academy lesson 11](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/tree/master/learning-to-code/iterators)

Text in bold from lesson plan 

## Learning Goals:
- Vocabulary: blocks, loops, iterator, iteration, iteration variable, counter-controlled, sentinel-controlled, loop table, times loop, range, while loop  
- To know the purpose for iteration in creating programs  
- To write loops in order to prevent code duplication and repetition  
- To understand how a loop will execute the statements inside and what the resulting output will be  

## Activities:

## Notes:
Loop and iteration are the same terms  
Two categories and four types here-   
Counter or Sentinel  
Times Range-each While Until
