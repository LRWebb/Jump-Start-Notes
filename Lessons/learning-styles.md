## Lesson 1: Learning Style
Text in bold from lesson plan  

### Learning goals:
**Explore your learning style
Find strategies that allow you to consume and retain information quickly, and increase your understanding**

Important- **Learning how to learn is one of the fundamental steps to becoming a successful software developer.**
Learning programming is concepts and vocabulary
Try different strategies as you go

## Activities:

Thoughts- 
VARK! Neil Fleming- Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing Preference, and Kinesthetic.
I do rewrite my notes, but I also listen to a lot of podcasts-
Even after reading this, I’m not sure what my main learning style is. Reading the additional link, http://vark-learn.com/introduction-to-vark/the-vark-modalities/, I could be multimodal
Thinking about it more, I noticed that video learning is hard for me- it's harder for me to pay attention to a video than a podcast- which is strange, but true for me
Since I think I'm a combination learner, I'm going to gather all the strategies in my notes here as things I could try:

#### Visual Study Strategies
* Utilize graphic organizers such as charts, graphs and diagrams
* Redraw your pages from memory
* Replace important words with symbols or initials
* Highlight important key terms in corresponding colors
#### Aural Study Strategies
* Record your summarized notes and listen to them on tape
* Have a discussion with others to expand upon your understanding of a topic
* Reread your notes and/or assignment out loud
* Explain your notes to fellow "aural" learners
#### Read/Write Study Strategies
* Write, write and rewrite your words and notes
* Reword main ideas and principles to gain a deeper understanding
* Organize diagrams, charts, and graphic organizers into statements
#### Kinesthetic Study Strategies
* Use real life examples, applications and case studies in your summary to help with abstract concepts
* Redo lab experiments or projects
* Utilize pictures and photographs that illustrate your idea

### Learning to code strategies
#### Before the lesson
* Read the notes, and highlight the pieces that you anticipate will be most challenging for you to absorb
* Write or review the learning goal for the lesson
#### During the lesson
* Keep a vocabulary sheet where you write down relevant new vocabulary and definitions in your own words
#### After the lesson
* Read the notes, and highlight the parts that were challenging to understand and make yourself notes with further explanations or examples
* Write down the main points of the lesson
* Explain the main points of the lesson to someone else
* Write out example code using the same concepts
* Find other example code online and then write comments of explaining what is happening
* Try small exercise drills that reinforce the concept

### General strategies
* After you've moved forward in your learning, go back and redo an old assignment from scratch
* Start by typing in code that you already know works, then make small changes to the code, predicting the output/change and then verifying if that assumption was correct
* Ask someone else to walk you through their code without your computer in front of you, listening attentively and asking questions
* Become a questioner, engage yourself in lectures and discussions by asking questions.

As I read through these strategies and descriptions again, I think I'm an Aural learner- I do re-ask questions and like to talk things through. Maybe that's why videos don't work for me- I can see the person but I can't ask a question- but why do I like podcasts and find them better then?

[How Successful People Stay Calm](http://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbradberry/2014/02/06/how-successful-people-stay-calm/)
Reading this I thought a lot of a friend- she can go from "mistake" to "everything is ruined" really quickly. The chart shows how stress can really negatively affect thinking. 
Intermittent stress is different from constant stress- constant stress is worse
"Top performers have well-honed coping strategies that they employ under stressful circumstances. This lowers their stress levels regardless of what’s happening in their environment, ensuring that the stress they experience is intermittent and not prolonged."

#### Ten recommended strategies: 
1. Appreciation- improves mood, reduces cortisol
2. Avoid asking "What if?"- don't imagine the worst case scenario, take action
3. Stay positive- choose something positive to think about. Don't flood yourself with negative thoughts
4. Disconnect- Don't be available 24/7, give yourself a break esp. from tech and online
5. Limit caffeine- caffeine triggers adrenaline- hmm, I am nervous about drinking less coffee
6. Sleep- It's recharging for your brain- good for self-control, attention, and memory
7. Identify and resist negative self talk- don't be mean to yourself in your head. Negative thoughts are thoughts, not facts. "When it feels like something always or never happens, this is just your brain’s natural threat tendency inflating the perceived frequency or severity of an event. Identifying and labeling your thoughts as thoughts by separating them from the facts will help you escape the cycle of negativity and move toward a positive new outlook."
8. Reframe perspective- this is so good- grabbing the chunk of it "You can’t control your circumstances, but you can control how you respond to them. So before you spend too much time dwelling on something, take a minute to put the situation in perspective. If you aren’t sure when you need to do this, try looking for clues that your anxiety may not be proportional to the stressor. If you’re thinking in broad, sweeping statements such as “Everything is going wrong” or “Nothing will work out,” then you need to reframe the situation. A great way to correct this unproductive thought pattern is to list the specific things that actually are going wrong or not working out. Most likely you will come up with just some things—not everything—and the scope of these stressors will look much more limited than it initially appeared."
9. Breathe- yes! Meditation has been so good for me. 
10. Use your support system- also super super good- grabbing the chunk: "To be calm and productive, you need to recognize your weaknesses and ask for help when you need it. This means tapping into your support system when a situation is challenging enough for you to feel overwhelmed. Everyone has someone at work and/or outside work who is on their team, rooting for them, and ready to help them get the best from a difficult situation. Identify these individuals in your life and make an effort to seek their insight and assistance when you need it. Something as simple as talking about your worries will provide an outlet for your anxiety and stress and supply you with a new perspective on the situation. Most of the time, other people can see a solution that you can’t because they are not as emotionally invested in the situation. Asking for help will mitigate your stress and strengthen your relationships with those you rely upon."

Reading Felder and Soloman’s learning styles I see a lot of myself in the Sequential one. I mean, to even do this Jump Start I made a spreadsheet first thing and I’m working through it- that’s pretty sequential :)

#### Active and Reflective
Active prefer to discuss or do first- try it, like group work
Help themselves by: Study in a group, find ways to do things with the information

Reflective want to think about it first- let's think about it, prefer working alone
Help themselves by: stop while you read and try to think of possible questions or applications. Write summaries. 

#### Sensing and Intuitive
Sensing like learning facts, dislike surprises
Help themselves by: look for real world examples

Intuitive like discovering possibilities and relationships, dislike repetition
Help themselves by: look for connections, take time with details

#### Visual and Verbal
Visual remember what they see
Help themselves by: Look for visual representation of the information being taught. Make your own concept map. Color code. 

Verbal get more out of words- written and spoken 
Help themselves by: Write summaries or outlines in your own words. Work in groups to talk things through.

#### Sequential and Global
Sequential are linear, logical
Help themselves by: outline the lecture material. Try to connect things

Global make jumps
Help themselves by: Skim the entire chapter to get an overview
