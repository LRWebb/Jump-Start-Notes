Text in bold from lesson plan

## Learning Goals:
**Understand what an algorithm is  
Develop your own algorithm for a task, test, refine, and evaluate it**  

## Activities: 
:heavy_check_mark:  **Start by reading through our notes on algorithms.**

“An algorithm is a series of steps to solve a problem.” - https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/blob/master/preparing-for-ada/problem-solving/algorithms.md
Procedures of varying degrees of preciseness. Computers cannot assume. 
Donald Knuth- algorithms have “five basic properties, finiteness, definiteness, inputs, outputs, and effectiveness.”

### Properties of algorithms:
1. Finite- it starts and ends  
2. Definite- no ambiguity  
3. Inputs- things going in  
4. Outputs- results going out  
5. Effectiveness- if it works, how well it works  

:heavy_check_mark:  **Write an algorithm for getting to the house of a family member or friend (you pick a specific person)? Make sure to include all 5 essential elements of an algorithm: input, output, finiteness, definiteness, and effectiveness.**

**Input:** Initial state is the person in the algorithm is me, with a driver’s license and the ability and knowledge to drive, with my glasses on, and with an operable car (don’t have a car, but for this let’s assume I do).  
**Output:** The result wanted is I get from my house to my friend’s house.  
**Finiteness:** The time frame is one hour  
**Definiteness:** The steps below should be precise enough for a different person (or computer hah) to follow  
**Effectiveness:** As much as possible, the steps below should have few assumptions  
**Algorithm:**  
You start from your apartment in West Philadelphia. Make sure you have your keys, glasses on, and wallet with drivers license. If you’re missing any of those items find them first and take them with you. You exit your apartment, go downstairs and outside to where the car is parked. Unlock the car and get in. Turn the car on and check for traffic, then when the way is clear, move from a parked position into the street. Following traffic laws, drive north west to Cedar Ave. Look for a parking space close to your friends house. When you find one, signal that you’re parking, park and turn off the car. Get out and lock the door, then walk to your friend’s house using the sidewalks and ring the doorbell. You’re here!  

:heavy_check_mark:  **Watch the Driverless Car Hits the Street - Not People (2008) and think about why writing instructions for computers might be different than writing instructions for humans.**

Well my first thought is, they got a Lotus to play with?! Wow, that would be fun :) Second thought is it’s interesting the way Brian Deery talks about self-driving cars- “Where the road is, where we are, and where we need to be” It’s a DARPA program… Walt Silva- “To make vehicles driverless takes humans out of harms way”  I disagree with this. I think in some situations yes, it can be safer, but in military implications not necessarily. For the difference between writing instructions for computers vs humans, I think a big difference is how much knowledge people have. Yes, a computer can hold thousands of books worth of knowledge- but can it use that the way people can?

:heavy_check_mark: **Then watch The 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge Finals (2015), a more recent video and think about what the computer scientists writing code for these robots have to think about. What inputs do they have? What is their intended output? How are their algorithms considered Definite, Effective, and Finite?**

Interesting that getting out of a car is one of the most difficult things for a robot to do. I didn’t think about that, but now that I am I’d agree- even for people there’s a ton of balance, strength, and shifting of weight involved. I liked the way William Billy Howell was talking and handling his stress- I liked that he was honest about it, but could also present the situation (falling robot, damage to a project he spent 4 years doing) in a positive and hopeful way (something to learn, going to get better) Douglas Stephen- “Just because a robot looks like a human, does not mean it’s processing information like a human” Looking at this video and the robots moving around, I think the inputs are visual, laser, weight, and resistance (when turning a knob). I think their intended output depends on where they are in the competition, and includes advancing, climbing, turning things, and removing obstacles. I think the algorithms are definite, effective, and finite because there’s a human controller involved- even though these robots are going through somewhere alone, it looked like it took a lot of human input.

:heavy_check_mark:  **Finally, complete either the peanut butter (or alternative) and jelly sandwich activity, or the paper snowflake activity.**

Hm I need to find someone to do this with me- will come back to it

**(Option 2) Make a Paper Snowflake
For this activity, you will write precise instructions to make a paper snowflake. You will need to find someone to carry out those instructions to test your algorithm's clarity. While they are following your instructions, you are only allowed to watch, they are not able to ask you questions.
When listing the steps in your procedure, you should assume the person following your instructions is as straightforward as a computer (they do not make assumptions or ask for clarity). Let the person know who is following the instructions to interpret them as literally as possible. If your algorithm does not work out as expected, modify your algorithm and test on a new person until you get the desired output.**

Thinking I'll ask a friend to do the paper snowflake one- seems more fun and I can email the instructions. 

### Instructions to make a paper snowflake: 
* Please follow the steps below.  
* Please interpret them as literally as possible.   
* I cannot answer questions.  
* Please email me a picture of the result and let me know if the instructions below had any gaps.  

Steps:
1. Follow these steps in order, unless you're directed to a specific step- if so, go there next. 
2. Get a piece of paper that you don't mind cutting up. The paper should be larger than 4inX4in and smaller than 4ftX4ft. 
3. Get a pair of scissors. The scissors have to be a functional cutting tool- it cannot be an image of a pair of scissors, or a pair of scissors that cannot cut. 
4. Sit down with the paper and the scissors, either on the floor, at a desk, or at a table. 
5. Take the piece of paper and use the scissors to cut it into a square if it isn't a square already. The square should be as large as the paper will allow. 
6. Place the paper on the flat surface in front of you- either the floor, the desk, or the table. The paper should rest fully on the flat surface, the paper should not be balanced on its edge. The paper should be oriented so that the edge closest to your torso as you sit facing it is a horizontal line, not a point. Nothing should be on the paper or blocking you from folding it. 
7. Fold the bottom left corner diagonally to the top to make a triangle. Crease the edge of the fold you just made. Do not unfold. 
8. Fold the bottom right corner diagonally to the top left corner to make a smaller triangle. Crease the edge of the fold you just made. Do not unfold. 
9. Orient the triangle you now have so that the point with a 90-degree angle is closest to your torso and the longest edge of the triangle is farthest from your torso. Fold the triangle you now have into thirds. This will take two folds. The middle third will be the smallest. The two outside thirds should be equal size. Crease the edge of the folds you just made. Do not unfold. 
10. Your folded paper should look like an ice cream cone, with two pointy ends on top. If it doesn't, go back to step 9 and try a different fold of thirds. If it does, continue to step 11. 
11. Pick up the folded paper. Using the pair of scissors, cut the top- the part with two pointy bits-  of the folded paper off at a slight angle, not a straight line. 
12. You should still be holding the folded paper. If not, pick it up. Using the scissors, cut away random small triangle pieces of the folded paper, keeping it folded. Do not cut all the way from one side to the other. 
13. Unfold the folded paper carefully, taking care not to rip the paper. 
14. Lay the snowflake flat and take a picture of it. Make sure you have a light on to take the picture. Take the picture in a digital format that you can email. 
15. Email the picture to me!
All right, emailed to a friend- I'm nervous about step 9 but excited to see the result!

I love it! SO beautifullll :)

### Optional readings:
:heavy_check_mark: [What Is a Good Test Case?](http://www.kaner.com/pdfs/GoodTest.pdf) (Cem Kaner, J.D., Ph.D.)

Notes:  
Florida school  
2003  
A test case is - I like this definition best of the 4:  
Boris Beizer (1995, p. 3) defines a test as 
>A sequence of one or more subtests executed as a sequence because the outcome and/or final state of 
>one subtest is the input and/or initial state of the next.  

The word ‘test’ is used to include subtests, tests proper, and test suites.  

Kaner says a test case is a question that you ask of the program. 
We do this to find defects, maximize bug count, block premature product releases, help staff make decisions, minimize tech support costs, conform to regulations, minimize lawsuit risk, assess quality, and assure quality

Test type/styles- Kaner calls these **paradigms:**

* Function testing
* Domain testing
* Specification-based testing
* Risk-based testing
* Stress testing
* Regression testing
* User testing
* Scenario testing
* State-model based testing
* High volume automated testing 
* Exploratory testing

Fleshed out definitions of these types are on pgs 7-13 of http://www.kaner.com/pdfs/GoodTest.pdf
