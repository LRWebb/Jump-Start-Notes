Text in bold from lesson plan, other text mine

## Learning Goals:
**Gain some tools for thinking critically about power and privilege in tech communities  
Begin approaching tech diversity initiatives with an intersectional lens  
Gain familiarity with the concept of microaggressions, and develop some initial strategies for intervention**  

### Ada's statement of inclusivity
**Students, staff, volunteers, TA's, and reps from our sponsor companies come to Ada Developers Academy with an incredible diversity of identity and experience. We strive to make Ada an inclusive, safe, and equitable space for every member of our community. We recognize and celebrate difference along many axes including, but not limited to, sexual orientation, gender identity and presentation, age, race, ethnicity, class, religion, physical appearance, ability, national origin, educational background, and parental status. Our community includes women and gender diverse people (people who identify as trans, non-binary, gender queer, gender fluid, and gender non-conforming).**

Then read and reflect on these articles

Reading: glossary and three articles
Interesting to think of oppression as “socially supported.” Thinking about it, it does fit, but I’ve never seen it put so bluntly
“Wait for (white) women to get theirs, then we’ll get to you.” - oof
I used to read a lot of books about horses and racing. For a while I thought TERF had something to do with the track. I do know what it means now. 
I like this from https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2016/04/13/how-be-ally-someone-experiencing-microaggressions-essay: 
“Observe: Describe clearly and succinctly what you see happening.
Think: State what you think about it.
Feel: Express your feelings about the situation.
Desire: Assert what you would like to happen.”
I've been practicing the above  

## Reflection:
**Take some time to reflect on the readings. This reflection can take on whatever form works best for you, you might want to have conversations with people about what you read, spend some time free form writing, create a video sharing what you learned or maybe produce a piece of art. It is totally up to you and what works best for you.**

I’m writing a few notes now, and I know I’ll come back to this. The non-binary one especially.
Okay I'm back. Reflecting for me primarily includes writing and talking. I'm going to write freeform here, we'll see if I get nervous and come back to edit it. Thinking about my upbringing, it was a weird combination of insider-outsider. The phrase I heard a lot was "in the world but not of it." 
I kept questioning. Still do. I don't have all the answers, but I do know there are different ways to live, and that people grow up in different ways and face the world with different or less, or more advantages. I believe that a person has a right to define themselves, and if someone through reflection says "I'm not the gender I was assigned," who am I to argue with that? Am I more of an expert in their personal life than they are? No. 
Dissent is a skill I am working to level up. For most of my childhood I was silent- I did question sometimes, but I was silent a lot more. But with more independance, I'm vocalizing dissent more with them.  
I see this as one of the ways I can support others- speaking UP. Speaking dissent.  Speaking comfort. Speaking encouragement.  

## Reflection questions:
**We are including a few reflection questions which you can use as a guide if you are having trouble getting started. You can address all of our prompts, choose only a few, or come up with your own.
What, if anything, was new to you here? What additional questions does this raise for you?**

Non-binary is a newish term to me. I'm still reading about it- I think it means gender-neutral but I'm not sure. Intersectionality I have heard before in combination with feminism: "intersectional feminism" but it was really helpful to read the term definition in Ada's glossary. 

**After reading Joy's article, what is one way you would like to see tech companies or organizations champion diversity and inclusion beyond "women"?**

I see this and I agree with it- it seems like sometimes “women” is actually a much more narrow term that only has room for white women with supportive husbands, good insurance, and savings. So, we’re celebrating successful people, but how much of that success is a result of other factors?

**Microaggressions are not explicitly defined in Rockquemore's article. Based on the context or on previous experience, how would you explain what a microaggression is in your own words? What are some examples of ways you can practice "micro resistance" in your own life?**

The last networking thing that I went to, that I was really excited about, men assumed I was catering staff. When they were wrong they turned away from me and kept talking to each other. 
Thinking more about micro resistance lately. I’ve been repeating a phrase “I can stand it” So where normally I would cringe away from saying something, I’m thinking more, “I can stand this uncomfortableness, and push through to say what I want to say.”
