## Notes: 
The command line is very linear- you type something, it does it next

A command is an action we want the computer to do. An argument is additional info- not all commands need arguments. The prompt is the beginning of the command line- it can provide contextual info like where you are, who you are, etc. 

Commands generally have three parts: [command] [options] [arguments]

The terminal will take in what you write, do it, then display output if that's part of it. 

### Sample Commands:
**Try out these commands first, and record what happened.**

| Command | What happened? |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ls -a .` |It gave me the directory name Jumpstart | 
| `man ls` | It described what ls is|
| `q` | It quit my current view of the description of ls and took me back to the terminal line|
| `pwd` | It told me what directory path I was in|
| `cd ~` | It took me to the top of the directories|
| `cd .` | nothing|
| `cd ..` | When I used it later it took me up a directory|
| `cd -` | It listed the directory path I was in|
