### Notes: 
The command line is very linear- you type something, it does it next
A command is an action we want the computer to do. An argument is additional info- not all commands need arguments. The prompt is the beginning of the command line- it can provide contextual info like where you are, who you are, etc. 
Commands generally have three parts: [command] [options] [arguments]
The terminal will take in what you write, do it, then display output if that's part of it.
