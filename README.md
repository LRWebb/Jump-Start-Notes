# JumpStart-Notes
A place to gather my notes from working through Ada Academy's Launchpad curriculum 

This repo has the notes I made, per lesson. The lesson content is Ada's, the notes are mine. There's some links scattered throughout, and I intend to keep going back to these notes as I learn more.
