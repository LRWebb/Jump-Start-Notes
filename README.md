# Jump Start Notes
A place to gather my notes from working through [Ada Academy's Launchpad curriculum](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start)

This repo has the notes I made, per lesson. I'm moving them over from Google Drive, wish me luck! The lesson content is Ada's, the notes are mine. There's some links scattered throughout, and I intend to keep going back to these notes as I learn more.
